                  /</strong> Yeah, it’s a mouthful at first, but just
                  say it like this, “identity us.” Now just say
                  it faster.

               <h3>Who controls the domain while the lease in
                  in effect?
               </h3>
               <p></p>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p></p>
               <p>The domain owner always retains ownership
                  rights and control of the domains listed on Identitius. However, DNS
                  instructions are controlled by Identitius. So when you rent or lease a domain
                  name, you are given full DNS control as long as the terms of the lease
                  agreement are met.
               </p>

               <h3>How frequently do I need to make
                  payments?
               </h3>
               <p></p>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p></p>
               <p>We expect to see monthly payments most
                  often, but payments schedules are very flexible including quarterly, annually,
                  weekly or what ever is arranged in the lease that you
                  negotiate.
               </p>
               <p></p>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p></p>
               <h3>What if I have a late
                  payment?
               </h3>
               <p></p>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p></p>
               <p>The handling of late payments is determined
                  by the lease agreement. Often a grace period is establish, but this is
                  determined between you and the domain owner.
               </p>
               <p></p>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p></p>
               <h3>What if the domain was being used for
                  another website before I rent it? How do I handle that
                  traffic?
               </h3>
               <p></p>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p></p>
               <p>Just like any commercial real estate space,
                  a domain may have had a prior occupant. It is up to you how you handle traffic
                  that “walks in” looking for the prior occupant. We
                  find that this is usually a good thing because, well, free
                  traffic.
               </p>
               <p></p>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p></p>
               <h3>But SEO, doesn’t the prior
                  occupant impact our SEO?
               </h3>
               <p></p>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p></p>
               <p>Sure. But again, unless the prior occupant
                  “damaged” the property, you should be in a better
                  position than if you just start from scratch. Every existing backlink helps. In
                  some cases, this might even make the domain more valuable.
               </p>

               <h3>What if I do a bunch of work developing a
                  site and decide to change venues?
               </h3>
               <p></p>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p></p>
               <p>Again, think of this like a commercial real
                  estate lease. You can move your site wherever you want and let your customers
                  and Google know. You can ask websites with backlinks to your site to make
                  changes. But in the end, there may be some residual loss
                  there.

               <h3>What if I want to buy the domain?</h3>
               <p></p>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p></p>
               <p>To secure our domain lessees, every domain
                  listed on Identitius includes an option to buy. The option to buy sets price
                  for you to be able to purchase the domain. The expiration on this option is
                  usually the end of the domain lease, but may extend further. It will never
                  expire before the lease ends. This way, domain lessees are
                  protected.
               </p>
               <p></p>

               <h3>What if I don’t want to buy
                  the domain, but want to keep using it?
               </h3>
               <p></p>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p></p>
               <p>Once a domain lease ends, possession of the
                  DNS returns to the domain owner. However, prior to the lease ending, you will
                  be notified and it is usually desirable for both parties to continue the
                  lease.
               </p>

               <h3>What if there are prior trademarks on the
                  domain name being leased?
               </h3>
               <p></p>
               <p>&nbsp;</p>
               <p></p>
               <p>We ask all domain owners to guarantee that
                  their domains are free and clear of any trademark, copyright or other IP
                  infringements. Identitius makes no guarantees in this regard as it such issues
                  are between the domain owner and the party leasing the
                  domain.

               <p></p>
               <p>This is between you and the domain owner.
                  There may be a “purchase clause” whereby the domain
                  owner purchases such assets from you at a prearranged price, but
                  don’t expect much if anything.

               <p></p>
               <p>Sometimes, the domains have copyright or
                  trademark rights that are included, but check with the owner. Identitius makes
                  no guarantees as these concerns are to be resolved between the domain lessors
                  and lessees. Please consult with the domain owner and consider an attorney as
                  well. We have a list of attorney’s that are happy to
                  help.
