            <p>If you’re a startup or entrepreneur, you’ve likely been in that place we call the Domain Dump. You have
                the perfect domain in mind, but it’s already taken—and even worse, it’s sitting there unused. So, you
                move from “.com” down to obscurity, or you decide you’ll have to change your name altogether. What if
                you didn’t have to go back to the drawing board? Identitius is your affordable solution: Lease the
                domain you need from vetted owners who have already agreed to rent it out.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Snag a top-level domain at a fair price.</li>
                <li>Reduce the financial risk that comes with buying a domain outright.</li>
                <li>Kick-start your business and focus on what really matters to get it up and running.</li>
                <li>Have full DNS control.</li>
                <li>Negotiate lease or purchase terms with the domain owner.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You’ll have the option to buy the domain at any point during the lease, at the price you secured up
                front. We get it. Buying a domain can be risky when the future is uncertain…and contacting the domain
                owner to make an offer is easier said than done. Meanwhile, domain owners are waiting for the big pay
                day that never comes. Identitius bridges this gap to negotiate a win-win for both parties, in one
                platform that does the work for you.</p>
